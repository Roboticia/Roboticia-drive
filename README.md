# Roboticia-drive
An vehicle with different sensor. A lidar (RPLidar A2) to scan the surrounding and to make SLAM. A voice recognition and synthesis to be understood by your robot with voice. A camera to improve the percetion of the environnement (colors, shape and face recognition).
It can be 3D printed and laser cutted. It works with Dynamixel XL-320 motors, and a Raspberry Pi for control.

The Roboticia-drive is ideal to make SLAM algorithm and advance environnement perception.

It is particularly well suited for educational purposes (cheap, simple to assemble, and easily controllable) or research task (easy to adapt accordingly to your specific purpose).
